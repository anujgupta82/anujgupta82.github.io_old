I am new to the world of CNNs. While I have worked with neural nets in the area of text, when it comes to CNNs I have little knowledge. There are some awesome resources on the internet to learn on CNNs from ground zero. 

[Basics of CNN](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner's-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/) 3 part blog series. Builds the initial intuition very well. 

Another good resource is this [blog by Ujjwal](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/) 

Adam Harley's [blog](http://scs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/neural-networks/) on basic of CNNs. Its bit lengthy but if you are confortable with the key ideas discussed in first 2 blogs by Adesh and Ujjwal, this is a great post.

Wanna get a feel of CNNs in action ? check this [awesome visualization by Adam Harley](http://scs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/conv/flat.html). I highly recomend to play with it.
