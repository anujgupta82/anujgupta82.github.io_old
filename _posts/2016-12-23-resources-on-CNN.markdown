I am new to the world of CNNs. While I have worked with neural nets in the area of text, when it comes to CNNs I have little knowledge. There are some awesome resources on the internet to learn on CNNs from ground zero. 

[Basics of CNN](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner's-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/) 3 part blog series. Builds the initial intuition very well. 

Another good resource is this [blog by Ujjwal](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/)
