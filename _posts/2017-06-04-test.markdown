This guide is patterned after my ["Doing well in your courses"](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/advice.html), a post I wrote a long time ago on some of the tips/tricks I've developed during my undergrad.

### Preliminaries

First, should you want to get a PhD? I was in a fortunate position of knowing since young age that I really wanted a PhD. 








### Adviser

**Student adviser relationship**. The adviser is an extremely important person who will exercise a lot of influence over your PhD experience. It's important to understand the nature of the relationship: the adviser-student relationship is a symbiosis; you have your own goals and want.
 


### Research topics

So you've entered a PhD program and found an adviser. Now what do you work on?








### Writing papers

Another great resource on this topic is [Tips for Writing Technical Papers](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/widom/paper-writing.html) from Jennifer Widom.

### Writing code

### Giving talks

So, you published a paper and it's an oral! Now you get to give a few minute talk to a large audience of people - what should it look like?

**The goal of a talk**. First, that there's a common misconception that the goal of your talk is to tell your audience about what you did in your paper. 



### Attending conferences

### Closing thoughts

I can't find the quote anymore but I heard Sam Altman of YC say that there are no shortcuts or cheats when it comes to building a startup. You can't expect to win in the long run by somehow gaming the system or putting up false appearances. I think that the same applies in academia. 
So at the end of the day it's quite simple. Do good work, communicate it properly, people will notice and good things will happen. Have a fun ride!
